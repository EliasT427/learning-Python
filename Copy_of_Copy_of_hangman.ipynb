        "## Expectations\n",
        "- use the predefined `get_word()` function to generate a random word\n",
        "- give the user an amount of attempts equal to the length of the word +3\n",
        "- create an empty list that will hold the guesses that the user has made\n",
        "- during each guess the user is expected to either enter a single character (all lowercase), or the entire word if they think they know what it is.\n",
        "- if the user guesses a letter that has already been guessed, they should be told that they've already guessed that letter and their number of attempts should not be decreased.\n",
        "- Each time the user guesses a letter, print out a string with underscores where letters havent been guessed yet and characters from the word where it has been **(for example. p_th_n if the user has correctly guessed these letter in the word python)**\n",
